Four easy steps to protect business growth from cyberattacks,20220325T140059,"Research bears this out. In a recent survey by the Small Business Administration, 88% of small-business owners said they believe their business is vulnerable to a cyberattack. Additionally, many of these businesses said they don't have the budget to pay for solutions and have limited time and resources to devote to cybersecurity. At the same time, organizations that are increasingly concerned about the risk to their business don't know where to begin. If that's the case for your business, you can begin with these four steps. They're simple, they will significantly improve your cybersecurity posture, and they're relatively quick to implement-which is critical. Because cyberattacks can interrupt revenue and derail growth investments, with the total cost of a data breach averaging $3.86 million in 2020, according to the Ponemon Institute. Many SMBs think they lack the budget and personnel to implement around-the-clock monitoring and detection of cyberthreats across their infrastructure. But that's not the case. Today, there are a growing number of managed detection and response  ( MDR )  service providers that can help organizations continually watch for any incoming threats  ( detect ) , and then take action  ( respond )  to security incidents if and when they happen.","[{'ticker': 'VZ', 'relevance_score': '0.041581', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '-0.198819', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Somewhat-Bearish'}]"

You're about see a lot more ads in video games,20220422T103041,"Sony is reportedly working on a plan to put ads into titles on its platform, borrowing heavily from the model that has been so successful in the mobile gaming world. The goal of the initiative, reports Insider, is for the ads to be integrated into the games, such as appearing on digital billboards in a sports stadium. The decision on whether to include ads will apparently be up to the developer, meaning you're less likely to see a promotion for Mountain Dew or Takis in big, AAA titles like Call of Duty or God of War. But smaller, independent games-especially those that utilize the free-to-play model-could embrace the ads. In-game advertising has been a hot-button issue in the core gaming world for more than two decades. In 2002, Simon & Schuster Interactive published Darkened Skye, a 3-D action fantasy game that featured a lot of what players expected in these games at the time: Ancient worlds, nefarious enemies, and buxom heroines. But it also had some blatant product placement, requiring players to collect Skittles candy to gain mana. The entire game was set in worlds depicted in Skittles commercials at the time.","[{'ticker': 'VZ', 'relevance_score': '0.064623', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '0.078833', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Neutral'}]"
