Atticus, a skincare company, caters to the oft-neglected market of men who want to pamper their skin and chase that dewy glow. And Eadem created a dark-spot serum specifically formulated for women of color, who often struggle to find products designed for the unique concerns of melanin-rich skin. The industry also made strides this year in its ongoing mission to become greener, more ethical, and more sustainable. Beauty giant L'Oréal unveiled a new hair-wash system for salons that could save up to a billion gallons of water per year. Hourglass Cosmetics, meanwhile, engineered the first-ever vegan, cruelty-free replacement for carmine-a ubiquitous ingredient that gives makeup a brilliant, rich red hue-which was historically made by killing and crushing thousands of female insects.

"McDonald's closing all its stores in Russia is a big deal, even if it's a little late",20220308T214507,"While known for its franchise model, McDonald's owns more than 80% of its 847 Russian restaurants, and sales in that country make up about 9% of total revenues. In his company-wide memo, Kempczinski said the company will continue to pay the salaries of its 62,000 employees in Russia, and the Ronald McDonald House Charities will continue to run there. In Ukraine, the CEO said McDonald's continues to pay full salaries for its Ukrainian employees, has donated $5 million to its Employee Assistance Fund, and continues to support relief efforts led by the International Red Cross in the region. As one of the world's most famous brands, McDonald's had been called out for being late in its reaction to the Russian invasion, with #BoycottMcDonalds becoming a trending Twitter topic. While major brands like Visa, MasterCard, Nike, Netflix, Alphabet, Apple, Levi's, and many more had earlier suspended sales and/or operations, the Golden Arches stood out-until now. The significance of McDonald's closing its operations holds more weight, given its historical role in opening Russia up to Western culture after the Cold War. Three months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the company opened its first location in Moscow.","[{'ticker': 'NKE', 'relevance_score': '0.083804', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '0.092323', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Neutral'}]"
"War will end when Putin realizes it puts his own leadership at risk, top State Department official says",20220308T214640,"War will end when Putin realizes it puts his own leadership at risk, top State Department official says Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland testifies before a Senate Foreign Relation Committee hearing on Ukraine on March 8 in Washington, DC.  ( Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images )  Victoria Nuland, the US State Department's undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, said Tuesday she believes the war will end ""when Putin realizes that this adventure has put his own leadership standing at risk, with his own military, with his own people, that he is hemorrhaging the lives of the people of Russia, the army of Russia and their future to his own vain ambition."" Speaking at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Nuland said at that point, Putin ""will have to change course, or the Russian people take matters into their own hands."" But from the US perspective, the end game is the strategic defeat of President Putin in this adventure,"" she said. Asked what drove Putin to invade now, Nuland said such a question would have to be directed to the Russian leader, but added she believes that ""over the years, President Putin's imperial ambition has grown and he is dissatisfied with the last 30 years of Russian history and has longed for some time to be the guy that helps recreate the Soviet Union, the fall of which he said was one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century."" ""I think in the last couple of years he's been particularly obsessed with this and particularly consumed. He has created, as you know, a whole bed of lies about how the US would use Ukraine as a springboard to Russia or that NATO would, and he has frankly made clear in the last couple of days that he doesn't actually think that Ukraine is an independent country from Russia,"" she continued. ""And so I think his interior mind is now out there and for everybody to see. So that's what makes me worried that not only do we have to ensure that this Ukraine gambit is a strategic failure for Putin for Ukraine's sake, but also for all of the other countries in the region, and his appetite has only grown with the eating. So you know, we can't allow this to stand,"" Nuland said.","[{'ticker': 'NKE', 'relevance_score': '0.014434', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '-0.162681', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Somewhat-Bearish'}]"
"Ukraine responds to Russia ceasefire proposal: ""It is difficult to trust the occupier""",20220308T224400,"European countries prepare for an influx of refugees as hundreds of thousands flee Ukraine Since the start of the Russian invasion, more than two million people have fled Ukraine. The European Union is being told to brace for as many as five million Ukrainian refugees, CNN's Anderson Cooper reported from Kyiv. Moving forward, the question stands: how are other European countries going to handle the steady influx of refugees? ""The numbers are just staggering. They're coming in, in the hundreds of thousands at this point,"" said Chris Skopec, executive vice president of Global Health at Project HOPE. ""We've seen two million in 10 days. We've never seen anything like this."" Poland alone has seen 1.2 million refugees cross its border, and as Skopec notes, the Polish government itself has offered an outpouring of support. ""They're helping them get access to shelter, to clothes, to food,"" he told Cooper. As for Skopec's organization specifically - Project HOPE - the emphasis is on the most immediate, basic needs, including medical services for refugees upon arrival. ""The situation inside Ukraine is such that the primary health care system has been devastated. Hospitals are completely out of supplies ... and just desperate for more support. People are coming after days and days of trying to travel and get into a refugee country, a hosting country. They are coming across. We're seeing exhaustion, dehydration, gastrointestinal issues and certainly a lot of emotional and traumatic issues, just in how they are being able to cope with what's happening,"" said Skopec, adding, ""The ability to get us medical care immediately as a matter of priority, screen them, try to understand what support and assistance they need ... that's really what our top priority is right now."" With the number of refugees expected to increase in the coming weeks, Skopec is moved by the generosity of spirit he's witnessing from humans willing to provide assistance and aid to each other. ""We're seeing a huge number of people coming from around Poland, individuals out of the goodness of their heart, hoping to try to help out and provide people with rides, homes to stay in, temporary shelters, so they have [a] place to go. Really people are moving as quickly as they can through the border areas getting into major cities,"" he said. Skopec went on to share a story of a woman who was dealing with a range of emotions as she fled Ukraine for a safer space. ""I met a woman today right at the border, a Ukrainian woman, who on one hand was laughing at how ridiculous it was that she was getting on the first bus she could find to a city she'd never heard of in Germany, and then the next second turns around and is just weeping at the fact that she had to leave behind her two sons and her husband, and was all alone by herself and had no idea what she was going to do, and where she was going to go,"" he said. A Ukrainian refugee fled to Moldova.

What Nike taught me about collaborative design,20220309T120012,"If there was a slider between fun and hard work, their lives seemed to skew toward an even blend, while the rest of us had tipped the scales to the more pragmatic end of the spectrum. But when I actually got into global footwear in 2007 after more than a year as a financial manager there, I realized how wrong I was to hold these common misperceptions. The footwear process was so much more than watching a designer field a brief from category leadership and sketch pretty pictures. One of my friends at Nike was Dr. D'Wayne Edwards, who at the time was the footwear design director for the Jordan brand. Upon learning my story and seeing my raw explorations, he decided to give me a chance to apply my raw creative skill to a real product. This was my one shot to execute footwear design under his mentorship.","[{'ticker': 'NKE', 'relevance_score': '0.217404', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '0.532949', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Bullish'}]"
Are naps coming back with us to the office?,20220309T120046,"Swapping a rush hour commute for a stroll down the hall was nice. Ditching corporate clothes and ""career pants"" for T-shirts and shorts was freeing. But, for many people, the best telecommuting perk was the ability to take a nap whenever the need arose. As omicron fades and infection rates tumble, though, a growing number of companies are summoning employees back to the office. Does this mean the days of weekday napping are in danger? Ultimately, it could depend on where you work. Some big tech firms, including Meta and Google, have ""nap pods"" in offices around the world, areas that are converted to quiet spaces that have individual cubicles for people to sleep. Other companies that were offering dedicated nap spaces in pre-pandemic days include Ben & Jerry's, Cisco, Zappos, and Nike. The CEO of consulting firm Brooks Bell is also a big advocate of the nap. ""I've found napping can become a gateway to other healthy activities,"" he wrote in Fast Company in 2020.","[{'ticker': 'NKE', 'relevance_score': '0.071293', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '-0.172725', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Somewhat-Bearish'}]"

"Pusha T, Arby's, and why more brands should be willing to pick a fight",20220326T100000,"What made this even more compelling was that Pusha was not just a paid spokesattacker or a particularly passionate consumer of fast-food fried fish. No, Pusha was apparently relishing this project to continue his claim that he wrote-and was underpaid for-McDonald's global tagline and song ""I'm Lovin' It,"" which launched in 2003. Pusha told Rolling Stone this week that his spicy take was inspired by resentment over lack of credit and payment. ""I did it at a very young age, at a very young time in my career where I wasn't asking for as much money and ownership,"" he said. ""It's something that's always dug at me later in life like, 'Dammit, I was a part of this and I should have more stake.' It was like half a million or a million dollars for me and my brother-but that's peanuts for as long as that's been running."" ""I'm the reason the whole world love it, now I gotta crush it/Filet-O-Fish is sh*t/You should be disgusted/How dare you sell a square fish asking us to trust it/A half slice of cheese, Mickey D's on a budget?"" Coming just over a month after his latest Ye-produced single ""Diet Coke,""  ( which was definitely not a branded track ) , the overall online reaction to ""Spicy Fish Diss"" was Supa Hot Fire-ing across social media. Fans were, um, lovin' it. According to marketing analytics firm Apex Marketing, within just a couple of days, the song had generated $8 million in advertising value for the brand. As a single piece of advertising, this is a bonafide hit. Brands continue to pan for pop cultural gold in the hopes that it'll get them any attention, and you could do much worse than enlisting the world's preeminent diss-track rapper to take a swing at your industry's largest player. In evaluating it, ad strategy heads have spent the week asking themselves, Why this celeb? Why this brand? Is there a genuine pop culture insight here?

Nike's new VP of digital design hails from Twitter and Netflix,20220415T183041,"Davis has deep roots in the tech industry. As detailed in my profile last year, Davis was previously the first chief design officer at Twitter  ( and the company's first Black executive to report to the CEO ) . There, he tried to rid the platform of toxic behavior at the same time that he faced accusations of fostering a hostile workplace. He was subsequently let go in a reorg. Previous to that, Davis helped create Netflix's digital interface-a system that has been cloned by virtually every media streaming company today. Designers with experience in the C-suite are rare. In Davis, Nike lands a hands-on designer-executive who studies user behavior closely, experiments publicly, and has a fast metabolism for shipping product. Davis made the announcement on Twitter yesterday, and Nike has since confirmed his hire. Today marks the next chapter in my career and I'm honored to be joining Nike as Vice President of Digital Design.

But the branding moment, the name, and the T-shirt success belongs to the Suns marketing team and the years of work leading up to their winning dunk. During the post-game press conference, it was a Suns social media producer that asked Ayton what he thought of the phrase Valley-Oop, and the Suns center replied, ""I love that.""

The ad world's ultimatum to Netflix: Be bold,20220423T110006,"This week, the company revealed in its first quarter earnings report that instead of adding more than 2 million subscribers as it predicted three months ago, Netflix ended up losing 200,000. Obscured by the global math is the fact that in North America, it actually lost 600,000 subscribers. The news triggered the company's stock to swan dive by 25% immediately. Hastings, it's safe to say, has had a change of heart. ""Those who have followed Netflix know that I have been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,"" Hastings said during Netflix's prerecorded earnings call interview.
