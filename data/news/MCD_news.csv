As one of the world's most famous brands, McDonald's had been called out for being late in its reaction to the Russian invasion, with #BoycottMcDonalds becoming a trending Twitter topic. While major brands like Visa, MasterCard, Nike, Netflix, Alphabet, Apple, Levi's, and many more had earlier suspended sales and/or operations, the Golden Arches stood out-until now. The significance of McDonald's closing its operations holds more weight, given its historical role in opening Russia up to Western culture after the Cold War.

"Why your brand should think less about designing a logo, and more about designing a sound",20220314T130058,"Digital billboards and moving online interfaces are becoming ubiquitous, as are a myriad of voice technology applications.

And it's all for good reason: Sound is the fastest human sense, faster than smell, taste, sight, and even touch. Combine that with the fact that music elicits emotion, which is a big driver in brand loyalty, and the potential for sound in branding is crystal clear. One of the most successful examples of this is McDonald's long-running ""I'm Lovin' It"" campaign and jingle. Created in Germany back in the mid-noughties by ad agency Heye & Partner in conjunction with music production company Mona Davis, the famous earworm was aided by the release of a full-song version sung by Justin Timberlake, released at first with little mention of McDonalds. By the time the song started to circulate, the five-note earworm of ""ba-da-ba-ba-baaa"" was stuck in our brains for good, and it's been used to memorable effect ever since.","[{'ticker': 'MCD', 'relevance_score': '0.159358', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '0.302122', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Somewhat-Bullish'}]"

What happened to Starbucks? How a progressive company lost its way,20220317T100045,"Marketed as ""a completely different Starbucks built on effortless convenience"" when it opened last November, this store-called Starbucks Pickup with Amazon Go-is the first of three that the coffee company plans to debut in New York. It is also a striking symbol of Starbucks's quiet brand transformation from warm gathering spot to tech-enabled caffeine depot and of the challenges the company faces today. Starbucks clearly recognizes that it's at an inflection point: The company announced yesterday that its CEO of five years, Kevin Johnson, is stepping down.  ( Starbucks's stock rose 7% on the news. )  In the 1990s, Starbucks began to position itself as ""the third place,"" a spot between home and work where customers could find comfort, community, and good coffee. The notion had been inspired by longtime CEO Howard Schultz's visit to Milan's convivial espresso bars in the late 1980s, and Starbucks has exported the experience widely, operating 34,000 stores in 84 markets. The company built upon this ethos to provide employees with ""a welcoming and uplifting third place"" as well, one that over the years has included generous policies such as healthcare benefits for part-time employees, a purposefully inclusive workplace, free college tuition, and paid parental leave. Along the way, Starbucks has gotten gargantuan. It has become the third-largest global restaurant chain, after Subway and McDonald's, although it's growing faster than either. The company plans to add 2,000 stores this year, many of them in China, an explosive market-the company's second largest-where, since 2020, it's been opening a new store every 15 hours. If you'd invested $10,000 during Starbucks's initial public offering in 1992, today it would be worth north of $3 million.","[{'ticker': 'MCD', 'relevance_score': '0.022435', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '-0.205041', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Somewhat-Bearish'}]"

Pusha told Rolling Stone this week that his spicy take was inspired by resentment over lack of credit and payment. ""I did it at a very young age, at a very young time in my career where I wasn't asking for as much money and ownership,"" he said. ""It's something that's always dug at me later in life like, 'Dammit, I was a part of this and I should have more stake.' It was like half a million or a million dollars for me and my brother-but that's peanuts for as long as that's been running."" ""I'm the reason the whole world love it, now I gotta crush it/Filet-O-Fish is sh*t/You should be disgusted/How dare you sell a square fish asking us to trust it/A half slice of cheese, Mickey D's on a budget?"" Coming just over a month after his latest Ye-produced single ""Diet Coke,""  ( which was definitely not a branded track ) , the overall online reaction to ""Spicy Fish Diss"" was Supa Hot Fire-ing across social media. Fans were, um, lovin' it. According to marketing analytics firm Apex Marketing, within just a couple of days, the song had generated $8 million in advertising value for the brand. As a single piece of advertising, this is a bonafide hit. Brands continue to pan for pop cultural gold in the hopes that it'll get them any attention, and you could do much worse than enlisting the world's preeminent diss-track rapper to take a swing at your industry's largest player. In evaluating it, ad strategy heads have spent the week asking themselves, Why this celeb? Why this brand? Is there a genuine pop culture insight here? Is the brand appropriating pop culture or participating?","[{'ticker': 'MCD', 'relevance_score': '0.142883', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '0.546816', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Bullish'}]"
