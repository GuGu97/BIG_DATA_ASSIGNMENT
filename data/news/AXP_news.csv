Biden weighs easing sanctions on Venezuela to isolate Russia and increase oil production,20220307T180200,"Biden weighs easing sanctions on Venezuela to isolate Russia and increase oil production The Biden administration is weighing the possibility of easing sanctions on Venezuela so that the country can begin producing more oil and selling it on the international market, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The move would be aimed at reducing global dependence on Russian oil amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and at isolating Russia from one of its key allies in South America, the person said. Biden administration officials, including National Security Council Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez and US special presidential envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens, were dispatched to Caracas over the weekend for talks on the issue, the person said, as well as to discuss the American citizens currently detained in the country. The New York Times first reported the officials' travel to Venezuela. Remember: Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil in 2019 and closed its embassy in Caracas after deeming Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's election victory in 2018 to be a sham. U Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that the US and allies were actively exploring ways to ban Russian oil imports, thereby damaging Russia's economy even further. The West has been reluctant so far to impose significant sanctions on Russia's energy sector because of how it might impact the global economy, but are now getting closer to doing so as Europe works to diversify its energy sources. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio has already criticized the discussions, tweeting over the weekend, ""Rather than produce more American oil,"" Biden ""wants to replace the oil we buy from one murderous dictator with oil from another murderous dictator."" But the source with knowledge of the talks said that merely increasing American oil production would not make up for the amount lost by cutting off Russia.","[{'ticker': 'AXP', 'relevance_score': '0.079748', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '-0.515172', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Bearish'}]"

Speaking at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Nuland said at that point, Putin ""will have to change course, or the Russian people take matters into their own hands."" But from the US perspective, the end game is the strategic defeat of President Putin in this adventure,"" she said. Asked what drove Putin to invade now, Nuland said such a question would have to be directed to the Russian leader, but added she believes that ""over the years, President Putin's imperial ambition has grown and he is dissatisfied with the last 30 years of Russian history and has longed for some time to be the guy that helps recreate the Soviet Union, the fall of which he said was one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century."" ""I think in the last couple of years he's been particularly obsessed with this and particularly consumed. He has created, as you know, a whole bed of lies about how the US would use Ukraine as a springboard to Russia or that NATO would, and he has frankly made clear in the last couple of days that he doesn't actually think that Ukraine is an independent country from Russia,"" she continued. ""And so I think his interior mind is now out there and for everybody to see. So that's what makes me worried that not only do we have to ensure that this Ukraine gambit is a strategic failure for Putin for Ukraine's sake, but also for all of the other countries in the region, and his appetite has only grown with the eating. So you know, we can't allow this to stand,"" Nuland said.","[{'ticker': 'AXP', 'relevance_score': '0.014434', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '-0.162681', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Somewhat-Bearish'}]"

"Ukraine responds to Russia ceasefire proposal: ""It is difficult to trust the occupier""",20220308T224400,"European countries prepare for an influx of refugees as hundreds of thousands flee Ukraine Since the start of the Russian invasion, more than two million people have fled Ukraine. The European Union is being told to brace for as many as five million Ukrainian refugees, CNN's Anderson Cooper reported from Kyiv. Moving forward, the question stands: how are other European countries going to handle the steady influx of refugees? ""The numbers are just staggering. They're coming in, in the hundreds of thousands at this point,"" said Chris Skopec, executive vice president of Global Health at Project HOPE. ""We've seen two million in 10 days. We've never seen anything like this."" Poland alone has seen 1.2 million refugees cross its border, and as Skopec notes, the Polish government itself has offered an outpouring of support. ""They're helping them get access to shelter, to clothes, to food,"" he told Cooper. As for Skopec's organization specifically - Project HOPE - the emphasis is on the most immediate, basic needs, including medical services for refugees upon arrival. ""The situation inside Ukraine is such that the primary health care system has been devastated. Hospitals are completely out of supplies ... and just desperate for more support. People are coming after days and days of trying to travel and get into a refugee country, a hosting country. They are coming across. We're seeing exhaustion, dehydration, gastrointestinal issues and certainly a lot of emotional and traumatic issues, just in how they are being able to cope with what's happening,"" said Skopec, adding, ""The ability to get us medical care immediately as a matter of priority, screen them, try to understand what support and assistance they need ... that's really what our top priority is right now."" With the number of refugees expected to increase in the coming weeks, Skopec is moved by the generosity of spirit he's witnessing from humans willing to provide assistance and aid to each other. ""We're seeing a huge number of people coming from around Poland, individuals out of the goodness of their heart, hoping to try to help out and provide people with rides, homes to stay in, temporary shelters, so they have [a] place to go. Really people are moving as quickly as they can through the border areas getting into major cities,"" he said. Skopec went on to share a story of a woman who was dealing with a range of emotions as she fled Ukraine for a safer space. ""I met a woman today right at the border, a Ukrainian woman, who on one hand was laughing at how ridiculous it was that she was getting on the first bus she could find to a city she'd never heard of in Germany, and then the next second turns around and is just weeping at the fact that she had to leave behind her two sons and her husband, and was all alone by herself and had no idea what she was going to do, and where she was going to go,"" he said. A Ukrainian refugee fled to Moldova. Here's what she said to CNN's Ivan Watson:","[{'ticker': 'AXP', 'relevance_score': '0.013872', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '-0.162681', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Somewhat-Bearish'}]"
