What happens when hype is misplaced,20220304T080000,"One of the most successful of these projects centers on a community of disillusioned apes. The creative brainchild of four anonymous thirtysomethings, Bored Ape Yacht Club  ( BAYC )  is a collection of 10,000 unique ape avatars minted as NFTs that double as membership tokens to an exclusive online social club with real-world perks. The entire project sold out within 12 hours at an initial asking price of 0.08 ETH, about $190 USD at the time. But in the roughly nine months since the project's launch, it has become a cultural juggernaut, garnering interest from numerous celebrities, gracing magazine covers, and expanding beyond the Blockchain into the physical worlds of fashion, publishing, and music. As a result, the minimum price for a BAYC NFT has skyrocketed from a fancy dinner to a modest house. By the end of 2021, BAYC had already surpassed $1 billion USD in sales, achieving the milestone faster than many of the largest and most influential companies in the world.","[{'ticker': 'KO', 'relevance_score': '0.039977', 'ticker_sentiment_score': '-0.3312', 'ticker_sentiment_label': 'Somewhat-Bearish'}]"

In Ukraine, the CEO said McDonald's continues to pay full salaries for its Ukrainian employees, has donated $5 million to its Employee Assistance Fund, and continues to support relief efforts led by the International Red Cross in the region. As one of the world's most famous brands, McDonald's had been called out for being late in its reaction to the Russian invasion, with #BoycottMcDonalds becoming a trending Twitter topic. While major brands like Visa, MasterCard, Nike, Netflix, Alphabet, Apple, Levi's, and many more had earlier suspended sales and/or operations, the Golden Arches stood out-until now. The significance of McDonald's closing its operations holds more weight, given its historical role in opening Russia up to Western culture after the Cold War.
